Sample Commands and Responses for EduChain MCP Server
=====================================================

This file contains sample test commands and their corresponding responses from the EduChain MCP server.

1. GENERATE MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS
=====================================

Command: "Generate 5 multiple-choice questions on Python loops."

Sample Response:
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the output of the following Python code?\n\nfor i in range(3):\n    print(i, end=' ')",
      "answer": "0 1 2",
      "explanation": "The loop iterates through range(3), which produces values 0, 1, and 2. The end=' ' parameter makes print() use a space instead of a newline.",
      "options": [
        "0 1 2",
        "1 2 3",
        "0 1 2 3",
        "Error"
      ]
    },
    {
      "question": "Which loop is best for iterating over a list in Python?",
      "answer": "for loop",
      "explanation": "The for loop is the most Pythonic way to iterate over sequences like lists, as it's more readable and efficient.",
      "options": [
        "while loop",
        "for loop",
        "do-while loop",
        "repeat loop"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

2. GENERATE LESSON PLAN

  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What data type is used to store whole numbers in Python?",
      "answer": "int",
      "explanation": "The int data type is used for integers (whole numbers) in Python.",
      "options": [
        "int",
        "float",
        "str",
        "bool"
      ]
    },
    {
      "question": "Which data type would you use to store 'Hello World' in Python?",
      "answer": "str",
      "explanation": "Strings (str) are used to store text data in Python.",
      "options": [
        "int",
